.SH DESCRIPTION
.I gridlisten1
has the same basic functionality as
.IR listen1 (8)
but also announces to an inferno registry service mounted at
.B /mnt/registry
.PP
The registry service must be mounted previously for the announcement to succeed. Additionally, the environment variable $myip will be used to provide the location parameter for the announcement. If this variable is not set, the $sysname will be used. The basic parameters and command syntax from
.I listen1(8)
also apply. It should be noted that unless the
.I -t
flag is used, the registry will need to be mounted by the
.B /lib/namespace
file on the system, because the change to user none rebuilds the namespace and the mount of the registry will be lost. The use of 
.I -t
eliminates the need for this but does mean the listener is run as the invoking user.
.SH EXAMPLES
Mount a registry service and announce a read-only export of Glenda's home directory:
.IP
.EX
srv -c tcp!registry.9gridchan.org!7675 gridregistry /mnt/registry
myip=publicly.ip.or.domain
gridlisten1 -t -d home -m /n/glen /bin/exportfs -R -r /usr/glenda

.IR listen1 (8)
.SH BUGS
If the registry announcement fails, the user still needs to interrupt the listen process
